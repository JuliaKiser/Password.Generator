## Project Description

In this unit we learned the basic functions of Javascript. For this project we were to use the starter code provided to enable our password generator to generate a password somewhere between 8 and 128 characters depending on the user selection and using a list of characters. 

The key points of this was developing variables to distiniguish your character bank, create prompts for user selection, and create functions that would ultimately generate the outcome of a random password.
